Hello! I am sharing some bass tabs that I have created myself :blush:.  
Most of them are my own transcriptions, while the rest are compiled from online sources (with the origins marked within the files).  
These tabs have been carefully organized and formatted by me to enhance readability and facilitate ease of performance.  
The tabs that I have personally transcribed include the original extracted bass audio, so if you are uncertain about any of the notes, you can cross-reference the audio for verification.  

I will be providing updates on the progress of my transcription work.  
If there are any other songs you are interested in, please let me know in the issues section, and I will consider transcribing them, but cannot guarantee completion :(  
Due to my personal preferences, the majority of these tabs are related to J-pop, Britpop songs, or anime songs.

If you utilize the tabs I have personally transcribed to perform and upload to public platforms, I would be most appreciative if you could provide proper attribution and cite me as the source :kissing_heart:.

- github: [@Canjia-Huang](https://github.com/Canjia-Huang)  
However, providing attribution is not an absolute requirement, as the copyrights of the musical works do not lie with me.

I hope these tabs will be helpful to you.  
Simply enjoy the music!
